\section*{Summary}
\markright{CONCLUSION}

The main goal of this thesis was to analyze and improve Courses 2 Assignments module. Courses 2 is a modular Learning Management System created in 2014 by Jakub Culik \cite{culik}. This system was build on modified CodeIgniter, modern PHP programming language framework with MVC architecture pattern with added support for HMVC architecture. We analyzed Assignments module of this system and proposed multiple improvements. This improvements may be split into two categories: Usability improvements and Introduction of new concepts into the learning process.

In the second part of this thesis we introduced Team Projects, which aims to teach teamwork and soft skills to the students. We also introduced Improved Submissions, which is a concept that aims to teach constructive critisism of other student's work and incorporation of this critisism into student's own work. Thirth important improvement is Assignment Mirroring. With Assignment Mirroring, every assignment students submits by an URL is mirrored on our servers. These assignments are mostly web pages created for Modern Approach to Webdesign course.

\assignment{MH: $\uparrow$ Again, it's not very good to use the term
``Improved Submissions'' as the reader may only check the conclusions and
thus she doesn't know what we mean, rather describe it somehow...}

With analysis of student feedback we also proposed new usability improvements. Most significant of them is Assignments Dashboard, which reminds students important dates, evaluations and feedbacks.

This work is also closely linked to other PhD. student's work, such as Veronika Dropcova's research \cite{dropcova}.

\section*{Results}
Our work resulted in better Assignments module with improved usability and new learning concepts implemented. Team projects, Improved Submissions, Assignment Dashboard are already used in the learning proccess at our faculty in courses like Modern Approaches to Webdesign or Algorithms and Data Structures.

Other concepts like Assignments Mirroring are implemented and ready for production with the expectancy to be used in the next winter semester.

Usability improvements we proposed and designed also led to better student satisfactory rate with the system, decreased student's confusion and frequently asked questions.

\section*{Future work}
This  work included a wide range of analytics and improvements, however, we believe there are still plenty more features to be added to the Courses 2 assignments module. This includes mostly new usability improvements, refactoring, evaluation of assignments and other nice-to-have features.

One of the desired improvements is automated evaluation of student's work. This may be done mainly with Assignments Mirroring. While we are mirroring these web pages, we may automatically evaluate for example validity of their HTML and CSS source code.

Another usefull improvement is redesigning of user interface of the whole module. This module was created by multiple students and there is still a room to improve.
